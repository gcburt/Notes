## Arrays

The position of an item in an array is commonly called its *index*.

```swift
var pets = ["Murphy", "Hiro", "Milkshakes", "Sasha"]

pets.append("Amanda Trash Panda")
pets[0]
```
- Adds "Amanda" to the end.
- Calls "Murphy" because he is at the 0 index.


## Sets
## Dictionaries
## Enumerations

```swift
enum Weekdays { 
case monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday
}

var day = Weekdays.monday
day = .tuesday
```
// Notice the UpperCamelCase
