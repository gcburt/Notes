```swift
@Observable
class User {
    var name = "Grant"
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var user = User()
    
    var body: some View {
        Form {
            Text(user.name)
            TextField("Name", text: $user.name)
        }
    }
}
```

> State monitors changes in the User type. Technically, the User class isn't changing. The variables are. If i want my `@State` variable to watch my class, I need to add @Observable.
